**Install Ubuntu on Virtual Box**

An option for working on windows is to use a virtual machine like VirtualBox[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads] and install Linux on it. VirtualBox is an "emulator" that runs a fake Linux machine on top of your Windows machine. If you've never used Linux before, we recommend using Ubuntu.

Once you've installed VirtualBox and a Linux distribution, you can follow the Linux instructions.
